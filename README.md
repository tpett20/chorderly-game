# Chorderly
Chorderly is a Simon-style memory game that helps players learn to recognize musical chords and chord progressions by ear. 

"Chorderly" is a play on words that reflects the four game buttons each representing a chord in the key of C. One of the most common chord progressions in popular music is the I-V-vi-IV (1-5-6-4), along with other variations on the order. In the key of C, these chords are C Major, G Major, A minor, and F Major. Each one is represented by a game button in Chorderly. 

When the game starts, a random chord is played, and the corresponding game square lights up. Then, the player has to repeat it by playing the right chord. With each correct answer, the game will add another random chord to the sequence that the player must repeat. 

When a player is ready to fully test their musical ear, they can select the "Play by Ear" option. This stops the squares from lighting up when the game plays a chord. The player will have to repeat the sequence by relying only on sound.

Note that the chord squares are active before the game is started and after the game is over. The player can have fun playing music outside of gameplay. 

Note that the game can be played with a mouse or with the following keyboard commands (not case sensitive): 
- Space: Start Game
- N: Normal Mode
- P: Play By Ear
- Arrows ↑↓→←: Play Chords

Especially when playing the same chord consecutively, wait for the sound to finish before playing the chord again. 

# Next Steps
The game will eventually include options to change instruments and keys. This will allow the player to broaden the range of their musical ear. 

The game will also eventually feature a game mode that asks the player to repeat random chord sequences of a selected length. With each correct answer, the game will play a brand new random sequence.
