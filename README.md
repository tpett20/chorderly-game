Chorderly is a Simon-style memory game that helps players learn to recognize musical chords and chord progressions by ear. 

"Chordely" is a play on words that reflects the four game buttons each representing a chord in the key of C. One of the most common chord progressions in popular music is the I-V-vi-IV (1-5-6-4), along with other variations of the sequence. In the key of C, these chords would be C Major, G Major, A minor, and F Major, and each one is represented by a game button in Chorderly. 

The game will randomly play a chord and then the player has to repeat it. With each correct answer, the game will add another random chord to the sequence that the player has to repeat.  

When a player is ready to fully test their musical ear, they can select the "Play by Ear" option. This removes the color from the buttons when the game plays chords. The player will have to repeat the sequence using only the sounds of the chords.
