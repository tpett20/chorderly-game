# Chorderly
Chorderly is a Simon-style memory game that helps players learn to recognize musical chords and chord progressions by ear. 

"Chordely" is a play on words that reflects the four game buttons each representing a chord in the key of C. One of the most common chord progressions in popular music is the I-V-vi-IV (1-5-6-4), along with other variations on the order. In the key of C, these chords are C Major, G Major, A minor, and F Major, and each one is represented by a game button in Chorderly. 

The game randomly plays a chord and the corresponding game square lights up in color. Then, the player has to repeat it. With each correct answer, the game will add another random chord to the sequence that the player must repeat. 

When a player is ready to fully test their musical ear, they can select the "Play by Ear" option. This removes the color when the game is playing a chord. The player will have to repeat the sequence by relying only on sound.
